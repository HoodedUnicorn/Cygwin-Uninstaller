# Cygwin Uninstaller

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a Windows batch script for uninstalling Cygwin, a Unix-like environment and command-line interface for Microsoft Windows. The script deletes Cygwin shortcuts on the desktop and start menu, removes the registry node for Cygwin, deletes the Cygwin installation directory, and deletes any temporary files created during the installation process. The script is designed to be run as an administrator and provides feedback at each step, displaying messages to indicate what actions have been taken and whether or not they have been successful.

<h2>Installation</h2>

1.  Download the CygwinUninstaller.bat file from the repository.
2.  Right-click on the file and select "Run as administrator". <br>
2.1 If you are prompted with a Microsoft Defender Smartscreen popup, select More info and then Run anyway.
3.  Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the uninstallation process.
